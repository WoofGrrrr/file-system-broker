# FileSystemExp - A Thunderbird Web Experiments API That Provides Limited Access to The Computer's File System

Use this API to access files in the Thunderbird user profile directory/folder.

Until Mozilla has made a final decision about including the
[Chrome FileSystem API](https://web.dev/file-system-access/),
this API can be used as an interim solution.  (Actually, it
appears that the people at Mozilla may have decided not to
implement the Chrome FileSystem API.)

This API is an enhancement to the original API from the webext-support repository at
[webext-support FileSystem API](https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-support).

This enhancement provides a number of additional functions and features.

As an "Experiments API", in order to use ths API, it requires that you accept granting
full access to your system to Thunderbird.  This is considered by many to compromise
a computer's security.

I have provided this API for those extension developers who may already need to use the
Experiements API for other purposes.

If, as an extension developer, you don't wish to compromise security, or you have no
other need to use the Experiements API, you can instead use the
[FileSystemBroker Extension](https://github.com/WoofGrrrr/file-system-broker)
and its
[FileSystemBroker API](https://github.com/WoofGrrrr/file-system-broker/tree/main/modules/FileSystemBroker).

With the FileSystemBroker Extension and its API, you can write an extension that can
access the computer's file system without having to use the Experiments API and thus
requiring your extension's users to grant full system access to your extension.  You
can simply use the FileSystemBroker API, and let it use the FileSystemBroker Extension
to to the files system access on your extension's behalf.

The API uses inter-extension messaging to request services from the extension. The API
sends a message to the extension, the extension receives the message and performs the
requested command, and finally responds with another message with the results of the
command.

**Note: Currently does not work with TB78.**


## How to Use the FileSystemBroker API

* Add the [FileSystemExp API](https://github.com/WoofGrrrr/file-system-broker/tree/main/apis/BrokerFileSystemExp)
to your add-on.

* Download the directory and its contents and copy them into the `"apis"` sub-directory for your extension

* Your extension's `manifest.json` file needs an entry like this:

```json
  "experiment_apis": {
    "FileSystemExp": {
      "schema": "apis/FileSystemExp/schema.json",
      "parent": {
        "scopes": ["addon_parent"],
        "paths": [["FileSystemExp"]],
        "script": "apis/FileSystemExp/implementation.js"
      }
    }
  },
```

* In your extension's JavaScript code, you use the API just like any other Web Extension API...

```
  const valid = await messenger.FileSystemExp.isValidFileName("file1.txt");
```
<br>
<br>

### The API uses the following directory/folder for file access:

```
<profile-directory>/FileSystemExp/<extension-id>/
```
Where:
  + \<profile-directory\> is the user's profile directory/folder
  + \<extension-id\> is the Extension ID of the extension using the API

On a Windows system, if the User ID of the user using Thunderbird were "user1",
and if the ID of your extension were "aaa.bbb@xxx.com", the pathName of this
directory would be something like this:
> C:\Users\user1\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\4x4rl22v.default-release\FileSystemExp\aaa.bbb@xxx.com

<br>
<br>

## The API provides these functions:

  + exists - does a file exist?
  + isRegularFile - does a file exist and is it a Regular file, i.e. NOT a Directory or "other"?
  + isDirectory - does a file exist and is it a Directory, i.e. NOT a Regular file or a a ""other"?
  + hasFiles - does a Directory have any items (Files, Directories, or "Other") in it?
  + getFileCount- how many items (Files, Directories, or "Other") does a Directory have in it?
  + writeFile - write text into a file in file system storage
  + replaceFile - write text into a file in file system storage, replacing any file that already exists
  + appendToFile - write text at the end of a file in file system storage, or create a new file if it does not already exist
  + writeJSONFile - write text into a JSON file in file system storage
  + writeObjectToJSONFile - write JavaScript object as JSON into a JSON file in file system storage
  + readFile - return the contents of a file as a strimg
  + readJSONFile - return the contents of a JSON file as text
  + readObjectFromJSONFile - return the JSON contents of a JSON file as a JavaScript Object
  + makeDirectory - make the directory for the calling extension
  + getFileInfo - return a FileInfo object containing the attributes for a file
  + renameFile - rename a Regular file
  + deleteFile - delete a Regular file
  + deleteDirectory - delete a Directory
  + listFiles - list the fileNames of only Regular files in a directory
  + listFileInfo - list FileInfo ibjects for only the Regular files in a directory
  + list - list fileNames of all items - Reguar files, Directories, and "other" - in a directory
  + listInfo - list FileInfo ibjects for all items - Reguar files, Directories, and "other" - in a directory
  + getFullPathName - return the full system pathName for a file
  + isValidFileName - is a fileName valid?
  + isValidDirectoryName - is a directoryName valid?
  + getFileSystemPathName - return the full pathName of the system directory on which this API operates
